Buteo is a simple web-based system monitor written in Python. It uses the
powerful Werkzeug WSGI utility collection and the Jinja2 template engine.

Installation
============

In order to install Buteo you have to install the Werkzeug and Jinja2 modules
first. If you have setuptools (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)
installed just do:

    # easy_install werkzeug jinja2
    
Otherwise have a look at http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/ and http://jinja.pocoo.org/
    
First run
=========

For testing purposes a simple web server is included. To start the test server
use the manage.py script:

    $ python manage.py runserver
    
Run the manage.py script without command line arguments to get more detailed
usage information.

It is not recommended to use the built-in web server in production environments.
Configure your system's web server to run Buteo via CGI, FastCGI oder mod_wsgi.

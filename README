Buteo System Monitor
====================

Buteo is a simple web-based system monitor written in Python. It uses the
powerful Werkzeug WSGI utility collection and the Jinja2 template engine.

At the moment only Linux systems are supported.

Required modules
================

In order to use Buteo you have to install the Werkzeug and Jinja2 modules
first. If you have setuptools (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)
installed just do:

    # easy_install werkzeug jinja2
    
Otherwise have a look at http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/ and http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/
    
First run
=========

You can run Buteo also without a complete installation. For testing purposes a simple
web server is included. To start the test server use the manage-buteo.py script:

    $ python manage-buteo.py runserver
    
Run the manage-buteo.py script with the -h option to get more detailed usage
information.

Installation
============

For a persistent installation use the setup.py script:

    # python setup.py install

Now all files and the management script are installed on your system:

    $ manage-buteo.py runserver

Configuration
=============

Have a look at the /etc/buteo.cfg file to configure Buteo. For example it's
possible to activate authentication, change the template, activate vnStat
information or to define a refresh interval.

Production environment
======================

It's not recommended to use the built-in web server in production environments.

Configure your system's web server to run Buteo via CGI, FastCGI oder mod_wsgi
(Apache). Example scripts for a web server setup can be found in 
/usr/share/buteo/scripts. See http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/documentation/0.5/deployment/
for further explanation.

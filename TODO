TODO:
 - Add ability for plugins to add a version string
 - Perhaps remove some math operations from templates in order to improve performance
 - Improve handling of plugin exceptions (completely leave out plugin if a exception occured)
 - Improve handling of non-existent options for plugins
 - Make it bullet-proof (try...except where required)
 - Percentage bars for memory
 - Improve layout of percentage bars

Future plans:
 - Configuration through a web interface
 - Get more detailed distribution data from /etc/*-release
 - Hardware information plugin
 - XML output (perhaps with a template)
 - Process list plugin
 - Services status plugin
 - Quota information plugin
 - Localization
 - Documentation (Sphinx?)
